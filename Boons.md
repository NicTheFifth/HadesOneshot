Boons are power ups given by the nine Olympian gods and are applied to all players. Thus the players have to pick one boon per option and this is applied to all.

## Level

Boons have levels and can be levelled up. When a boon is levelled up, it gains strength. The strength gained has diminishing returns, thus levelling the same boon again and again is not advisable for the players. There will be a table on each boons page on how it levels.

## Rarity

Boons also have a rarity, which in unique circumstances can be levelled up. There exist four rarities for boons, that being:
* Normal;
* Rare;
* Epic;
* and Heroic.

Once a boon has reached Heroic, it cannot get stronger through upgrading its rarity. A boon's initial strength is boosted with each step up in rarity, which also translates to levelling it. There will be a table on each boons page on how it changes strength with rarity.
## Type

Each boon has a type, this is: normal, special, dodge and unique. You can have only one each of the normal, special and dodge boon. Of the unique type, you can (in theory) get all.

The normal, special and dodge boons each modify the accompanying action. For example, a normal type boon may modify everyone's attack, by increasing damage or giving the target a status effect.

The unique type boons add a general modifier and has no limit on how many of this type you may have. These can modify mechanics, for example granting you two dodges during one turn, or increase your crit chance.

## Switching a normal/special/dodge boon

As said above, you may only have one each of the normal, special and dodge boons. However, there exists a mechanic that allows you to switch to another god's boon. The rule for this is the following:
1. The replacement boon will be the same level as the existing boon;
2. and the replacement boon will be one rarity higher.

These rules establish that a heroic boon will not have a possible replacement.

## Gods

As said above, boons are linked to a god. There is a possibility of 9 gods. However, in a campaign, you will have a limit on how many gods are possible. The limit of gods is 3. How this works in practice is that when you have boons from 3 different gods, these gods are the only gods you will still get. 

This means, if you remove a boon, which causes you to have boons from two gods only, you can get a third boon from any god again.
