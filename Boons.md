Boons are power ups given by the nine Olympian gods and are applied to all players. Thus the players have to pick one boon per option and this is applied for all.

## Level

Boons have levels and can be levelled up. When a boon is levelled up, it gains strength, though its effect

## Type

Each boon has a type, this is: normal, special, dodge and unique. You can have only one each of the normal, special and dodge boon. Of the unique type, you can (in theory) get all.

The normal, special and dodge boons each modify the accompanying action. For example, a normal type boon may modify everyone's attack, by increasing damage or giving the target a status effect.

The unique type boons add a general modifier and has no limit on how many of this type you may have. These can modify mechanics, for example granting you two dodges during one turn, or increase your crit chance.

## Switching a normal/special/dodge boon

As said above, you may only have one each of the normal, special and dodge boons. However, there exists a mechanic that allows you to switch to another god's boon. The rule for this is the following:
1. The replacement boon will be the same level as the existing boon;
2. and the replacement boon will be one rarity higher.
