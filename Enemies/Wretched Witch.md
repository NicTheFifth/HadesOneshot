#Tartarus 

The Wretched Witches are the lowest of the low, having practiced forbidden magics. Now their souls are condemned to haunt the chambers of Tartarus. The only thing they look forward to now is to destroy the living dead with cursed spells.

A Wretched Witch is 1x1 and has 5 HP in the first chamber.

Their base attack is firing a sphere that travels 5 squares per turn. When it hits a character it does 1d4 damage.

It can also charge one turn to do a spray attack, where it fires three sphere (one straight, two diagonal). Each hit does 1d4 damage.
