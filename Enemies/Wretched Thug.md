#Tartarus 

The Wretched Thug is one of the most common enemies in Tartarus. They are the most worthless of denigrates that washed down into the underworld, having been cut throats, knaves and other such petty criminals. Now all they can think about is battling with the half rotten weapons washed down the Styx.

A Wretched Thug is 2x2 and has 10 HP in the first chamber.

The base attack is `dice:2d4` in a 1x2 area. It takes one turn to charge.

It can do a swipe attack for `dice:1d4+1` in a half circle, diameter five centred on them. It takes one turn to charge.
