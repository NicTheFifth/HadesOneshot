#weapon 

The Heart-Seeking Bow was once wielded by lady Hera, arrows darkening the sky in the fight against the titans. Together with Zeus, many a arrow managed to pierce the hearts of those who created them. Yet, the history did not end there, with our prince Zagreus taking up this infernal arm, raining arrows down upon the shades in his attempts to escape this realm. Now, take this bow and indulge it, letting your aim be true.

The Heart-Seeking Bow has a base damage of 1d6, having a range of 6 squares. You may charge the bow for one turn to increase the range by 3 squares.

Your special shoots arrows in a 5 long cone, becoming two squares longer each square away from you. It does 1d4 damage, and does not continue beyond if an enemy is hit. (arrow pattern is shown below)
