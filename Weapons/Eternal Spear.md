#weapon 

The Eternal Spear is the most feared weapon amongst the shades, having been wielded by our Lord Hades. It pierced many a titan and slashed through foe without mercy. As his father, so too did our prince Zagreus wield this cursed infernal arm. It was strengthened with blood, but it thirsts still, shall you wash it with blood again?

The Eternal spear has a base damage of 1d6 with a range of two squares. You may charge for one turn to do a spin attack, dealing 1d6 damage in a 5x5 square centred on you.

Your special allows you to throw the spear in a straight line, damaging all enemies with 1d6, up to a max range of 9 squares. You may use a bonus action to recall the Eternal spear, doing the same damage on return.
