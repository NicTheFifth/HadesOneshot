#weapon 

The Shield of Chaos was wielded by Athena and Zeus to shield their allies from the titans reckless attacks and eventually shattered into pieces. However, its essence remained and became what our mighty prince Zagreus used to wreak havoc onto Elysium, blocking even the mighty axe of Asterius. Now, it has come into your hands, will you use its might to escape, or will you just shield yourself?

The Shield of Chaos does base damage 1d4, with range 1. It can be charged for one turn to become a bull rush, having you dash through 4 tiles with 1d6 damage. When charging, take half damage.

Your special tosses your shield, damaging six enemies in a 6 tile radius for 1d6.

Furthermore, as a bonus action, you may shield one of your allies, giving any attacks to them disadvantage (not possible whilst charging or after your special).
