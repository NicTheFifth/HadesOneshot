The Twin Fists of Malphon were the chosen infernal arms of lady Demeter. Her relentless attacks drove the Titans back, as they failed to defend. It was this arm that our great prince Zagreus used to pry open the gates of Elysium on his way to the surface. May you rain vengeance upon all who keep you chained down here.

The Twin Fists of Malphon have a base damage of 1d6. However, you may attack twice in the same turn, only switching target if your primary target dies. You may not move after attacking.

Your special smashes the area in front of you, dealing 1d6 damage in a 3 wide, 5 long area.
