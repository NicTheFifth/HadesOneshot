#weapon

The adamant rail is the gun of legend, having been wielded by none other than Hestia. Now it is your honour to wield this magnificent infernal arm to try what the great Prince Zagreus attempted millennia ago. Go forth and break free from the hell that is the underworld!

The Adamant Rail has a base damage of 1d4. However, you may attack twice in the same turn, only switching target if your primary target dies. It's range is 5 tiles.

The Adamant Rail has a base max ammo of 6, however it may be increased as you strengthen on your fight out. This means you must reload after 6 shots.

Reloading is a bonus action.

Your special is a grenade, it targets a 3x3 tile, within 9 tiles. It does 1d8 damage on hit. It does no friendly fire, however who knows what happens when it is stronger.
