#weapon 

The Stygian Blade was wielded by the might lord Poseidon, vanquishing his parents, the titans. Sadly now it is broken, but despair not, as the great prince Zagreus managed to turn Tartarus upside down with it, something you will undoubtably manage too.

The Stygian Blade has a base damage of 1d8. It's range is adjacent tiles. 

Your special is a smash attack, it attacks a 3x3 area around you, with you as the centre, for 1d6. After you special, you may do a dodge action with no movement penalty.
